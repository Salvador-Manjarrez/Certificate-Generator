# Certificate-Generator
This is a project I developed along with the very helpful guide of Baraja Swargiary from MERN Stack. It is a basic Javascript app that takes advantage of Canvas API to display an image pre designed by me which then takes into the drawing function a text input written and sent by the user everytime a key is pressed.

This way, plus adding any particular and desired font style (aswell as being able to completely redesign the certificate or image itself) we could use this app as an interaction with ours webÂ´s leads and general traffic to display to them how a certificate with their own name would look like.

* A download button is included in this repository version of the code to show intended functionality. It would not work as expected since tainted canvaes may not be exported. CORS Error.
